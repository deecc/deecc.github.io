[Covid cases in Chile and Peru](https://github.com/deecc/AS/blob/main/Topics%20in%20Mathematical%20and%20Computational%20Economics/Covid%20cases%20in%20Chile%20and%20Peru.ipynb): In this script we compare the daily confirmed cases of both symptomatic and deceased COVID in Chile and Peru in 2020 and compare them in relative terms in order to obtain the real impacts of COVID per million inhabitants.




[Covid cases by department in Peru](https://github.com/deecc/AS/blob/main/Topics%20in%20Mathematical%20and%20Computational%20Economics/Covid%20cases%20in%20Chile%20and%20Peru.ipynb): In this script we develop the 10 departments of Peru with the highest number of confirmed daily cases of both symptomatic and dead COVID per 100 thousand inhabitants in 2020.


[Covid_code1](https://github.com/deecc/AS/blob/main/Topics%20in%20Mathematical%20and%20Computational%20Economics/Covid_code1.ipynb): In this script we analyze positive cases, deaths, rapid tests, molecular tests and deaths of older adults for each department in Peru in 2020.



[Covid_code2](https://github.com/deecc/AS/blob/main/Topics%20in%20Mathematical%20and%20Computational%20Economics/Covid_code2.ipynb): In this script we compare the deaths in 2019 with those in 2020 in order to analyze the impact that COVID has had. This analysis is done at the departmental level and by age range (child, adolescent, adult and senior).
